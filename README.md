Example reinforcement learning code is in Maze Example. If you have all the libraries installed, run.py runs the reinforcement learning process for the canonical example.

Standard RL for the NWC deployment is in RL_NWC. run_NWC.py runs reinforcement learning for move recommendations, with the standard two hidden layer deep Q-learning network.

RL with location embedding for the NWC deployment is in RL_NWC_Embedding. run_NWC_Embedding.py runs the reinforcement learning for move recommendations, but with an embedding layer to deal with sparse location features.
